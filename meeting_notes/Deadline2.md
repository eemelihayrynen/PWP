# Meeting notes from discussion after deadline 2

- add restrictions to database tables where applicable
- could use enumerations in streaming services instead of a string
- make diagram like in deadline 1 for the completed database
- remove old extra line in movie database table, showing the relations more easily
    - done
- consider many-to-many relations with actors and director and movies
- relations not defined in sqlalqchemy in the python file, see excercise 1
- define what happens when entries are deleted from the database (cascade delete, set null, .etc)
- add mention of using sqlalqchemy and sqlite both in the readme and deadline 2 wiki pages
- add requirements.txt to the repo, delete the virtual environment
- explain how to fill the database with the included script
- expand population.py with testing of retreiving the data to see that it is correct
- some helper program can be used to browse sqlite databases
- 256 char for comments is too low (do we event want comments?)
- add notes of the meetings to the repo
