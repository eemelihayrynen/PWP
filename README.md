# Movie Search API

This repository contains code and [documentation](https://github.com/eemelihayrynen/PWP/wiki) of our Movie Search API implementation for the PWP course.

The repository includes a python virtual environment which has all the dependencies to run the project.

Were a using SQLite as the database format. The database can be populated using the script inside the database folder (currently adds only one entry). Example of moviesearch.db can be found under database/instance.

Dependencies.txt is its own file in the repository. 
The database can be populated with movies from database/movies_json_examples.json by manually taking the values and posting them with talented api tester.
