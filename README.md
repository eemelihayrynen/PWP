Movie Search API

This repository contains code and [documentation](https://github.com/eemelihayrynen/PWP/wiki) of our Movie Search API implementation for the PWP course.

The repository includes a python virtual environment which has all the dependencies to run the project.

The database can be populated using the script inside the database folder (currently adds only one entry). Example of moviesearch.db can be found under the same folder, also.
